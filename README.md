# Fizz

2D physics engine created in Nutella, a custom game engine I am developing. 

# Building

The project builds in two main phases. Fist, run `premake5 gmake2` to generate makefiles for the project. Then, build these makefiles as you normally would. The executable should be placed under `bin`, in a subdirectory corresponding to the build configuration.
